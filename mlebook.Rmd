# Description {#descrip}

One goal of social science is description-- describing the social world.

What are things we want to describe in political science?

  * Unemployment rate, GDP
  * Voter turnout, vote share for a party in an election
  * Percentage of women in the labor force
  * Inequality over time
  * Poverty rates over time
  * What else?
  
Why description? How is this useful?

  * Identify tendencies
  * Identify patterns or trends
  * Identify relationships between two or more factors
  * Help us generalize from anecdotes, what is common vs. uncommon? 
  * Diagnose demand, needs, potential problems, likely outcomes
  * Detect anomalies

How do we go about doing the work?
  
  * Start with a question (e.g., How is the economy doing?)
  * Find outcome data relevant to that question (e.g., GDP)
  * Find multiple units to compare (e.g., over time or across space)
    ** Multiple years of data (e.g., Compare U.S., from 1900 to 2020)
    ** Multiple countries from one year (e.g., Compare U.S. to Germany to other countries)
  * Summarize the data to help answer the question

Example: What is the direction of the country?
